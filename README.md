## Documentation

**What data is included?**

**1,447,270** building shapes in France (**704,172** with height inforamtion) and **54,515** building shapes in Denmark (**11,621** with height inforamtion). This data is represented in [shapefile](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles) format.    

**What was the creation process?**

The building shape information was hand digitized from high resolution aerial imagery.  The building height information was measured using sensors from low altitude aerial imagery. Due to the process in which the heights were calculated, the height value is an estimate and not the absolute measure of the building's height.  

**When was the data captured?**

The building shape and height information was captured and developed in 2013.  

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The building height information is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.

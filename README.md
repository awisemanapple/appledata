# Apple Building Height Data

This is not an [import](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import) proposal.  We are simply making data available to the OpenStreetMap community for a potential import.  

Please be sure to review and obide by the following guidelines prior to performing any import: [Import Guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) and [Automated Edits Code of Conduct](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct).


## Introduction

This dataset contains approximately **1,670,427** building heights matched to OSM buildings for areas throughout Germany & France. 

## License

This contribution is made available for use under the OpenStreetMap [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) license.


## Documentation

**What data is included?**

**425,751** building heights in Germany and **1,244,676** building heights in France correlated to OSM building ID in text file format. 

**What was the creation process?**

The building heights were measured using sensors from low altitude aerial imagery and then matched to its respective building footprint ID in OSM.  Due to the process in which the heights were calulcated, the provided height information is simply an estimation and not an absolute measure of height.  

**When was the data captured?**

The building heights were measured and calculated in 2013.  The OSM_IDs were captured and matched on 04/19/2017.  

**Why is the data being released?**

Apple would like to support the OpenStreetMap ecosystem by releasing high-quality height data to enhance existing building footprint data.

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The height data is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.

# Apple Building Height Data

This is not an [import](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import) proposal.  We are simply making data available to the OpenStreetMap community for a potential import.  

Please be sure to review and obide by the following guidelines prior to performing any import: [Import Guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) and [Automated Edits Code of Conduct](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct).


## Introduction

This dataset contains approximately TBD building heights matched to the respective building OSM_ID for several major cities throughout Germany & France. 

## License

This contribution is made available for use under the OpenStreetMap [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) license.


## Documentation

**What data is included?**

Approximately **TBD** million building heights correlated to OSM building ID for portions of Germany & France in [**Shapefile**](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles) format. 

**What was the creation process?**

These building footprints were hand digitized from very high resolution aerial photography captured by Microsoft. The Height attribute was interpolated from a digital terrain model derived from the same data.

**When was the data captured?**

The footprints were digitized in 2015 from imagery captured in 2014 & 2015

**Why is the data being released?**

Apple would like to support the OpenStreetMap ecosystem by releasing high-quality height data to enhance existing building footprint data.

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The height data is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.

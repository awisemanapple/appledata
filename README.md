FAQ

**What the data include:**
Approximately **TBD** million building footprints for portions of Germany & France in **Shapefile** format. 

**Creation Process:**
These building footprints were hand digitized from very high resolution aerial photography captured by Microsoft. The Height attribute was interpolated from a digital terrain model derived from the same data.

**Data Vintage:**
The footprints were digitized in 2015 from imagery captured in 2014 & 2015

**Why are the data being released?**
Apple would like to support the OpenStreetMap ecosystem by releasing additional high-quality building footprint data .

Documentation

The height data is measured in meters. Meters are the default unit for OSM height measurements (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units); no unit conversion is needed.

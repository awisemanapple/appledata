## Documentation

**What data is included?**

**425,751** building heights in Germany and **1,244,676** building heights in France correlated to OSM building ID in text file format. 

**What was the creation process?**

The building heights were measured using sensors from low altitude aerial imagery and then matched to its respective building footprint ID in OSM.  Due to the process in which the heights were calculated, the provided height information is simply an estimation and not an absolute measure of height.  

**When was the data captured?**

The building heights were measured and calculated in 2013.  The OSM_IDs were captured and matched on 04/19/2017.  

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The height data is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.

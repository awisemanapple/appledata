# Apple Building Height Data

This is not an [import](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import) proposal.  We are simply making data available to the OpenStreetMap community for a potential import.  Please be sure to review and obide by the following guidelines prior to performing any import.

## Introduction

This dataset contains approximately TBD building heights matched to the respective building OSM_ID for several major cities throughout Germany & France. 

## License

This contribution is made available for use under the OpenStreetMap [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) license.


## FAQ

**What the data include:**
Approximately **TBD** million building heights correlated to OSM building ID for portions of Germany & France in **Shapefile** format. 

**Creation Process:**
These building footprints were hand digitized from very high resolution aerial photography captured by Microsoft. The Height attribute was interpolated from a digital terrain model derived from the same data.

**Data Vintage:**
The footprints were digitized in 2015 from imagery captured in 2014 & 2015

**Why are the data being released?**
Apple would like to support the OpenStreetMap ecosystem by releasing high-quality height data to enhance existing building footprint data.


## Documentation

The height data is measured in meters. Meters are the default unit for OSM height measurements (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units); no unit conversion is needed.

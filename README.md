## Documentation

**What data is included?**

**852,379** building heights in France and **11,622** building heights in Denmark.  The building heights are labeled "top_height".  Each top_height value includes a latitude & longitude for its respective building center point.  

**What was the creation process?**

The building heights were measured using sensors from low altitude aerial imagery.  Due to the process in which the heights were calculated, the provided height information is simply an estimation and not an absolute measure of height.  

**When was the data captured?**

The building heights (top_height) were measured and calculated in 2013.  The latitude (lat) and longitude (long) values were calculated and captured on 04/28/2017.  

**What unit is the data measured in?**

The top_height data value is measured in meters. Please refer to [OSM height measurements](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/Units) for additional detail.
